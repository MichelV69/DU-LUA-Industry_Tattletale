# Industry Tattletale

## Purpose

Provide at-a-glance information about the status of running machinery in small industry builds

## Requirements

1 x Programming Board XS

1 .. 5 x Screen Unit (any size, personal taste)

1 .. 5 x Industry Unit

## Installation

 1. Install Programming Board XS (PB-Controller) somewhere easy to maintain
 1. Copy LUA code via `right-click -> Advanced` to the board
 1. Enter Build Mode
 1. Place one to five screens where-ever makes sense for you to monitor the machine status.
 1. Connect Screens and Industry
    1. Use the `Link Tool`, and then `right-click -> Link from` and select the first screen slot, and connect to the first screen.
    1. Use the `Link Tool`, and then `right-click -> Link from` and select the first industry slot, and connect to the first industry you wish to monitor
    1. Repeat as you require for up to five more Screen / Industry pairs.
        1. The App does not require any more than one Screen / Industry pair to function.  It will support up to five per PB.

## Recommendations

 1. Name your various pieces of industry something meaningful;  so "Basic Smelter M (27)" isn't that informative.  "Copper Smelter Center Top" is better.
